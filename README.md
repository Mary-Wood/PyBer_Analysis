# PyBer_Analysis

## Overview
The purpose of this project was to summarize the ride sharing data to examine trends over city type over a specific period of time.

## Results
### PyBer Summary
I analyzed the data for ride sharing between the three different city types of Rural, Suburban, Urban. I created a general summary, to include total rides, drivers, and fares for each of the three city types. The summary also includes the average fare per ride and average fare per driver.  Here is it clear that there are significant differences between the three city types in all of the fields. While there are less rides and drivers in rural areas, while they seem to get paid higher on average. However, the more urban the area is, price per ride fall but the quantity of rides and overall fares increase.

### PyBer Trends from Jan - April 2019
This data looked at a specific date range of January to April of 2019 total fares by each city type. All three city types experienced a spike in rides towards the end of February. But in other dates the trends between city types do not visually appear to be correlated.

## Summary 
There are several business considerations that can be made due to this data. It appears that while Suburban drivers make approximately half of the total rides, when compared to urban areas, there are only a fifth the drivers. However, these drivers are making about half of the total fares when compared to urban drivers. Here it appears that the suburban drivers are significantly more in demand. There may be opportunity to increase incentives for driving for PyBer in suburban areas to see if there is more demand that is simply being missed due to a lack of drivers. 
This data shows that while rural drivers make less trips, they make significantly more per trip. As such, it may be wise to look at increasing incentives to give rides during peak demand times (such as the end of February and early April). This could be done through advertising the busier times, so that rural drivers could maximize their time and efforts. 
Urban drivers make the most trips and the least fare per trip. Of course, this data does not examine factors such as length of trip, but it does illuminate some opportunities for maximizing efforts in high demand areas. Specifically, more research should be conducted to further understand some of the changes in demand to see if future drivers could have more tools to predict when the most rides would be needed to better plan their time and maximize profits.
